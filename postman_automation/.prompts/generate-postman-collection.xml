    Don't proceed if don't have access to context7.
    Don't proceed if environment is not ready. Docker containers must be running, external containers must be accessible.
    Always run CLI commands in the container where code resides.
    If you cannot find concrete information, STOP and ask rather than doing assumptions.
    Execute plan task-by-task validating each step before proceeding to the next one.

<context>
    I started to work with new service. My task is "test api".
    I found out that project doesn't have:
        1. Swagger documentation.
        2. Test cases for api testing.
        3. Automated tests.
</context>
<task>
    Your task is prepare postman collection and environment to run tests.
      1. Read `api/openapi.yaml` for endpoint definitions
      2. Read `api/api-test-cases.md` for test scenarios
      3. Generate Postman Collection with:
         - All API endpoints
         - Organized folders by tags/categories
         - Request examples
         - Pre-request scripts for setup
         - Test scripts for validation
         - Environment variables for chaining
