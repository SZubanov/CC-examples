    Don't proceed if don't have access to context7.
    Don't proceed if environment is not ready. Docker containers must be running, external containers must be accessible.
    Always run CLI commands in the container where code resides.
    If you cannot find concrete information, STOP and ask rather than doing assumptions.
    Execute plan task-by-task validating each step before proceeding to the next one.

    I started to work with new service. My task is "test api".
    I found out that project doesn't have:
        1. Swagger documentation.
        2. Test cases for api testing.
        3. Automated tests.
</context>
<task>
    Your task is prepare swagger documentation.
    Read code carefully. Identify all api endpoints from postman_automation/cmd/server/main.go or postman_automation/internal/handler
    Identify request and response structures.
    Based on this information create comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification file in yaml format.
    Specification has to include the following information:
        - All endpoints with full HTTP methods
        - Request/response schemas
        - Authentication schemes (JWT, API keys, etc.)
        - Error responses
        - Examples for each endpoint
        - Proper tags and grouping
    Requirements:
        - Use OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
        - Include detailed descriptions for each endpoint
        - Add request/response examples
        - Document all error codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
        - Include security schemes
        - Add server URLs
        - Use proper data types and formats
        - Include validation rules (required fields, min/max, regex)
