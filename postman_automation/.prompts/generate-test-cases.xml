    I started to work with new service. My task is "test api".
    I found out that project doesn't have:
        1. Swagger documentation.
        2. Test cases for api testing.
        3. Automated tests.
</context>
<task>
    Your task is prepare test cases for testing API.

        - Happy path scenarios
        - Validation errors
        - Authentication/authorization errors

        - Negative scenarios
